                    <b>Students :</b> Teacher, While I was researching and checking some sites and channels, I
                    remembered that we mentioned something about the guys who became famous by
                    accident. What about these guys? Did they have a plan or a strategy to post things for
                    their followers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Jake :</b> Good question! I don’t think they knew about all this when they started. This
                    is kind of new. Just by now that people are starting to understand the commercial
                    power of internet for common people like you and me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>John :</b> I think that in the beginning they were kind of amateur but after they realized
                    they were leaving some money on the table they must have started thinking very
                    seriously about that. At least, getting some specialist to do all this plan form them.
                    Otherwise, they wouldn’t have survived this long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Akira :</b> I agree with John. They must have gotten shocked with the money they were
                    losing and then, decided to find somebody to help them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Jake :</b> Guys this is exactly what happened with the big companies in the past. When
                    they realized they could reach much more people on the web, they decided to hire
                    some specialists to help them. That’s why Google got so interested in buying Youtube.
                    Today any person can start a career from scratch and become very famous and rich
                    just using social media. Justin Bieber is a nice example of that. He uploaded a video
                    on Youtube some years ago and because of his success on the web, some Record
                    label companies like Sony, Warner and others, decided to launch him officially to the
                    market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Laura :</b> Lucky boy. I don’t like him that much but I have to admit that he is a nice
                    example of becoming successful on the web

                </p>

                    <b>Jake :</b> Ok guys, we’re almost over and I’d like to ask you to Research about one topic
                    for the next class. Have you already heard something about getting to know your
                    Avatar?
                </p>
                <p><b>Students :</b> No teacher. I think it doesn’t have much to do with the movie, does it?</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Jake :</b> No guys. It’s another concept to learn about your potential followers. Please,
                    research something about that and bring your findings to that class ok.
                </p>
                <p><b>Students :</b> Ok Teacher.</p>
                <p><b>Jake :</b> So, that’s it for today. See you in the next class. Bye.</p>
